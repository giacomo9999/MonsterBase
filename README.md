Starting from:

Deployed version (which, until I write some code, is the AppDividend tutorial) at:

Current version deployed at:

Structural plan of attack before actually writing any code:

1. Change CSS framework from Bootstrap to Semantic UI.
2. Move database from local to mLab MongoDB. -- DONE, 4:06PM.
3. Deploy functioning version to Heroku. -- (surprisingly) DONE, 6:01PM.

Branching to implement switch from Bootstrap to Semantic...we'll see how that goes.

Update, 4:23PM - total disaster. Reverting (hopefully) to earlier commit.
